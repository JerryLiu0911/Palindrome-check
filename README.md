# Palindrome-check
1. Asks the user to input a word
2. Divide the word by 2 as a whole number to figure out the number of pairs of letters the word would have if it was a palindrome.
3. For the nearest even number of the number of letters in the word, compare the first letter to the last, second to second last etc.
4. If the letters are the same, store a flag/variable.
5. If the total amount of pairs calculated are equal to the prediction to if it was a predicition, print "this word is a palindrome."
6. Whereas if the total amount differs from the predicted number, print "this word is not a palindrome."
